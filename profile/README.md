## Hello from Norway's largest sports association ðŸ‘‹
.. and welcome to our GitHub page! ðŸ¥³
We are proud to be our country's largest sports association with more than 60 sports groups and 14 000 members.
Being such a big organization sure requires some technical stuff, so that's why we're here :raising_hand_man: :raising_hand_woman:
Our mission is not only to create solutions that we find useful ourselves, but also solutions that can make sports better in general.

## Who are we?
Our GitHub organization consists mostly of developers at NTNUI Sprint, the association's IT committee. We're also lucky to have some IT geniuses from the different sports groups as well ðŸ¤“

## ðŸ’š Contributing
We're always open for contributions, whether you are affiliated with NTNUI or not. Have a look at the issue boards in each of the repositories, or contact us at sprint@ntnui.no if you're not sure how to get started.
